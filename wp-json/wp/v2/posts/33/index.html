New Florida Bill Could Leave Parents Paying Child Support Indefinitely<\/p>\n<p>A new bill has been proposed in the Florida Legislature that could have a significant impact on child support laws in the state. The bill, known as Senate Bill 1328, aims to establish support provisions for dependent adult children. If passed, this bill would create procedures for filing civil suits to establish support for dependent adult children and redefine the term &quot;dependent adult child.&quot; It would allow for the payment of support to the adult child or their court-appointed guardian advocate, guardian, or agent, and provide the option for the court to assign the support to a special needs trust. These proposed changes have sparked a debate among legal experts and parents, as they could potentially leave parents paying child support indefinitely. But are they prepared for such a significant shift in the law?<\/p>\n<p>Opponents argue that the bill&#8217;s provisions go against the conventional understanding of child support, which typically terminates upon a child turning 18 or graduating from high school. Under the proposed legislation, child support orders would continue even after the child reaches adulthood, potentially burdening parents with financial obligations they did not anticipate. Supporters of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to address the unique needs of dependent adult children who may require ongoing support due to disabilities or other circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most controversial aspects of the bill is the provision that allows the court to irrevocably assign the support to a special needs trust or a pooled trust. While this may be a valuable option for families with dependent adult children with disabilities, it raises concerns about parental control and financial responsibility. Critics worry that parents may lose the ability to directly manage the support payments, potentially leading to misuse or mismanagement of funds.<\/p>\n<p>Another point of contention is the eligibility criteria for filing civil suits to establish support for dependent adult children. The bill specifies that such suits can only be filed in a certain court by specified individuals. This limitation may create hurdles for parents who believe they should be entitled to support for their adult child but do not meet the specific requirements outlined in the legislation.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the bill allows the court to order a father to pay attorney fees and certain costs and expenses to specified persons. While this provision may serve to ensure that dependent adult children have access to legal representation, critics argue that it places an undue financial burden on fathers, potentially discouraging them from pursuing legal remedies or participation in their child&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>If the bill becomes law, it would certainly have far-reaching implications for parents throughout Florida. It is important for individuals to stay informed about these proposed changes and understand how they may affect their rights and responsibilities. Whether one supports or opposes the bill, it is clear that the issue of child support for dependent adult children will continue to be a subject of debate and discussion. Ultimately, it will be up to lawmakers to determine the fate of the bill and strike a balance between the financial needs of dependent adult children and the rights and interests of parents.
