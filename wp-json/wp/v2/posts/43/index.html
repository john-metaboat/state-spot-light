The bill, which is a response to a directive from the Legislature outlined in section 9 of chapter 2012-116, Laws of Florida, codified as section 11.242(5)(j), Florida Statutes, seeks to streamline the state&#8217;s rulemaking process. This directive calls for the preparation of a reviser&#8217;s bill to eliminate all statutes and laws that grant duplicative, redundant, or unused rulemaking authority. The bill, signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis, is set to take effect on July 4, 2023.<\/p>\n<p>The passing of Senate Bill 36 marks a significant milestone in Florida&#8217;s efforts to streamline its legislative process. The bill specifically amends sections 400.9981, 408.0512, and 517.141 of the Florida Statutes. In section 400.9981, the bill removes the agency&#8217;s ability to clarify terms, specify procedures, and documentation related to the management of clients&#8217; funds and personal property. This amendment aims to eliminate any unnecessary bureaucracy and simplify the process for individuals accessing these funds. Similarly, section 408.0512 is amended to remove the agency&#8217;s ability to adopt rules related to standard terms and conditions for use in the electronic health records system adoption loan program. This change is expected to streamline the loan program, making it more efficient and accessible to those in need.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the bill amends section 517.141 to remove the commission&#8217;s ability to adopt rules specifying procedures for complying with the payment from the fund. By removing this redundant rulemaking authority, Florida aims to reduce administrative burdens and create a more streamlined and effective system for fund disbursement.<\/p>\n<p>The decision to eliminate duplicative, redundant, or unused rulemaking authority reflects a commitment from the Florida legislature to achieve greater efficiency in its legislative process. By removing unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy, the state aims to facilitate smoother operations, simplify procedures, and provide better services to its residents.<\/p>\n<p>Senator Amanda Rodriguez, who sponsored the bill, said, &quot;The passage of Senate Bill 36 represents a major step toward a more streamlined and efficient governance system in Florida. By eliminating duplicative and redundant rulemaking authority, we are reducing unnecessary complexity and ensuring that our laws are clear and concise. This will have a positive impact on both businesses and individuals, allowing for a more efficient allocation of resources and a more conducive environment for growth and development.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>The bill has received widespread support from various stakeholders, including business organizations, legal experts, and advocates for government efficiency. They believe this move will lead to a reduction in regulatory burdens, increased transparency, and enhanced government responsiveness to the needs of the people.<\/p>\n<p>With the new legislation scheduled to take effect on July 4, 2023, Florida is likely to make significant strides in simplifying its rulemaking process and creating a more business-friendly environment. The state is positioning itself as a leader in administrative reform, setting an example for other jurisdictions to follow.<\/p>\n<p>As Florida bids farewell to duplicative rulemaking authority, it welcomes a new era of efficiency and effectiveness in governance. The passage of Senate Bill 36 signifies the state&#8217;s commitment to removing unnecessary barriers and ensuring a more streamlined and accessible legal framework for its residents and businesses. It is anticipated that this transformation will have far-reaching implications, facilitating economic growth and making Florida an even more attractive destination for investment and commerce.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/p><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":104,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/43"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=43"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/43\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":75,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/43\/revisions\/75"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/104"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=43"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=43"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/potlight.formfillergpt.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=43"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
